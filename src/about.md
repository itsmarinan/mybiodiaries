I am a 23-year-old master student in Cancer Biology in London, a passionate reader (only when on tube and trains, therefore, a lot of time), a social media enthusiast and, of course, the reason that this blog is actually existing - I am a science lover! 

I do not have some great story of how I was passionate about science at the very early age. To be honest, I am not even sure how I felt about it throughout my first years pursuing Bachelor's in Biochemistry. I did find it interesting, but there is a lot of interesting stuff in the world that I could've done. 

That is how I felt until one turning point in my student life. I was an exchange student in Finland and joined one of the labs at the university there. For the first time, I saw science beyond textbooks and examinations and I was struck with how dynamic and compelling it was. It has been 3 years since that and the way I feel about science persisted. Most importantly, I want to be a an active part of it. 

In this blog, I want to share some science topics that I find captivating and thought-provoking. Besides that, I want to share me - how I got where I am now, but also to document in real-time my own journey in science.
