I am a 23-year-old master student in Cancer Biology in LondonðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, a social media enthusiast, a passionate reader (only when on tube and train, therefore, most of the time), and of course, the reason that this blog actually exists â€” I am a science lover! 

I do not have some great story of how I was passionate about science at the very early age. To be honest, I am not even sure how I felt about it throughout my first years pursuing Bachelor studies in Biochemistry in Serbia. I did find it interesting, but there is a lot of interesting stuff in the world that I could've done. 

That is how I felt until one turning point in my student life. I was an exchange student in Finland and I joined one of the labs at the university there. For the first time, I saw science beyond textbooks and examinations and I was struck with how dynamic and compelling it was. It has been 3 years since then and the way I feel about science persisted. Most importantly, I want to become a scientist one day.

But, before that time comes, I want to share some science topics that I find captivating and thought-provoking, as there is so much amazing work done by some incredible scientists. Besides that, I want to share me, myself, and I â€” how I got where I am now, but also to document in real-time my life in a new country and how I progress towards my goals. Let's bring it on!
