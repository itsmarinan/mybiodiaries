Out of all ways of fighting diseases that exist out there, vaccines specifically carry weight. There are only around 25 of them available, compared to, for example, 20,000 prescription drugs approved by the FDA. When we take into account the time it usually takes for vaccine development and that for some infamous diseases, like AIDS or hepatitis C, we still haven’t created them after all this time, it becomes clear that the only right way of talking about vaccines and vaccine researchers is with the utmost respect.

In this article, I would like to discuss one particular type of vaccine - the cancer vaccine. And, let’s put a big ‘’the’’ there as this one has been quite a torment. I will try to break down why that is so and how we still have faith in it in spite of quite a pile of discouraging research.

## **How do cancer vaccines work?**

As we all know, vaccines serve the eternal human fight against diseases and they do so by training the immune system to fight pathogens. When it comes to anti-cancer vaccines, their development started in the early 1990s, when the tumor-associated antigens were identified. Those antigens are expressed on cancer cells and immune responses to those antigens have been reported. Therefore, cancer vaccines commonly involve delivering tumor antigens whose aim is to stimulate the patient's adaptive immune response (T cells and B cells) against specific tumor antigens expressed on cancer cells.

### **Cancer antigens - essential, but a nightmare**

In an ideal setting, those targeted antigens would only be expressed on cancer cells and be present on every single one of them. They would also be essential for the survival of cancer cells, as well as possess the ability to provoke a significant immune response. You don’t need to be an expert in life sciences to understand that this is A LOT of conditions. Of course, antigens that fulfill all of that criteria are practically non-existent.

#### **What types of cancer antigens exist?**

When we talk about antigens as targets for tumor vaccines, we categorize them into two broad classes: tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor-specific antigens (TSAs).

#### **TAAs**

As their names suggest, the first group of antigens, although expressed on tumors, is also being present on normal, healthy cells. In this group belong, for example, PSA, which is a prostate-specific antigen produced in both normal and malignant prostate gland cells, and HER2, whose overexpression has been linked with the development and progression of breast cancer. 

#### **TSAs**

On the other hand, the TSA group comprises antigens expressed by oncoviruses and neoantigens that are encoded by cancer mutations. As their name suggests, they are actually tumor-specific and might hold more promise for cancer vaccine development.

##### **Viral antigens**

For example, oncogenic viral antigens have already been utilized for the development of the HBV (hepatitis B virus) vaccine which serves to prevent HBV infection. This vaccine has been proven to be successful and that is truly an important discovery, as chronic HBV is the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver cancer. Besides the HBV vaccine, scientists have been successful with developing the HPV vaccine against human papillomavirus which is a major cause of cervical cancer.

##### **Neoantigens**

Let’s now touch on the idea of using the other type of TSAs, the neoantigens, as attractive antigens for cancer vaccines. They are, as viral oncoproteins, specific only to tumor cells. But, they are even more specific - although viral oncoproteins are expressed in specific tumor types, this expression occurs in many patients. On the other hand, most of the neoantigens are unique to individual patients’ tumors (also referred to as private neoantigens). Therefore, there lies a potential for developing personalized therapies that would be tailored to each patient individually.

## **Many options, so why are we stuck?**

Before diving into why we still haven’t produced a cancer vaccine, let’s see what should be the goals when designing one. The most obvious one is - we want the tumor gone. We want to make sure that none of it is left after the treatment. But, we cannot stop at only tumor eradication - tumors do come back, as we are all aware, so we need to develop antitumor memory in the organism. And lastly, we want to minimize adverse reactions due to treatment.

### **Targeting TAAs**

So far, most cancer vaccines have targeted TAAs, also called self-proteins or self-antigens. Those were not very fortunate as B cells and T cells, our invaluable immune guardians, would bind strongly to these antigens and get deleted by immune tolerance mechanisms. Such mechanisms prevent our immune system from over-reacting and developing autoimmunity. Therefore, vaccines would need to promote either low affinity for antigen binding or stimulate the remaining reactive T cells and B cells. Unfortunately, success has not been achieved - although these vaccines managed to elicit the immune response, it wasn’t powerful enough to do anything significant. Besides this, targeting TAAs does not mean targeting only cancer. These antigens may be expressed on normal cells too, so we have to take care of normal cell toxicity. Sounds familiar? Chemotherapy, a major therapy for cancer, has this exact issue - attacking and killing the normal cells, besides cancerous ones. One of the major challenges of cancer treatments is how to leave normal, healthy cells unattacked.

### **Prophylactic vaccines**

Although we had quite a success with prophylactic vaccines (HBV and HPV vaccines), these vaccines have only been effective in the prevention of cancers caused by viral infections, therefore, not in treating established cancer. It should be noted here that, even though these vaccines have been great discoveries, treating an already developed cancer is of utmost importance, as most cancers still go unrecognized at the early stages. Besides, only around 10% of human cancers are actually caused by viruses.

### **What about neoantigens?**

When it comes to neoantigens as attractive targets, although tempting, it has been demonstrated that developing such vaccines is rather time-consuming, costly, and complex. After all, such vaccines would be an example of personalized medicine - treatment tailored to the individual patient. Implementation of personalized medicine practice into the healthcare system remains a challenge of its own, which I am looking to discuss in the upcoming blog posts.

### **Is there something more?**

Further down the line, there are other very compelling options for cancer vaccines, such as vectors. Those comprise cellular vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and molecular vaccines (peptide, DNA, and RNA vaccines). Some efficacy was noted in clinical trials with these vaccines, but they are still under development and face many complex challenges.

### **Vaccine + Drugs = ?**

The majority of phase 3 clinical trials did not confirm the encouraging preliminary results in early clinical trials. One of the explanations for why the cancer vaccines have failed is that they have been mostly tested on patients with metastatic cancers. In such a state, the immune system has already been severely suppressed by tumors. Following that, scientists came up with an idea to combine cancer vaccines with drugs that can reverse immunosuppression, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and anti-angiogenic molecules, and they demonstrated some success in doing so. Although there lies potential, much work has to be done to decide which combinations are most prominent.

## **What does the future hold for us?**

What we want from cancer vaccines is that they are safe, specific, and have a long-lasting response due to the stimulation of immune memory. We might have not been prosperous when it comes to developing them yet, but there is a lot of evidence out there supporting the notion that this field offers hope.

### **Novel immunotherapies - promising, but…**

First of all, our understanding of how cancer cells evade the immune system has tremendously improved. Thanks to that, we managed to develop several immunotherapies that produced remarkable responses in patients with some types of cancer. Still, nothing is perfect and finite when it comes to fighting cancer. Even though our understanding of the immune system has improved, we still don’t know it all. For example, many patients are not responsive to these novel immunotherapies and they even develop serious adverse effects. Could the cancer vaccine be a potential solution to that issue?

### **Can we even deliver the vaccine efficiently?**

As it always happens with science, many more doors get open than they get closed with every piece of research that has been done. When it comes to designing cancer vaccines, although scientists learned a lot from previous failed attempts, there are many unanswered questions and challenges. For example, how could we deliver such vaccines? Many options exist out there - nanoparticles, gene guns, microneedle arrays, etc. The delivery of the vaccine is a highly important determinant of its success so we have to understand the best ways to do so.

It is evident that there are a lot of challenges out there that will require a lot of time, effort, and resources, but the research regarding cancer vaccines is blooming! It remains for us to follow this exciting field and strive for the future where we will have cancer vaccines available as any other.
