In the past year, I was applying to several universities across Europe for my master‚Äôs degree. I was doing quite extensive research and in the end, I applied to several programs in four countries - Switzerland, Finland, Germany, and England. Some of these applications went great, others did not, but nevertheless, I learned a lot about the process and now I want to share with you what I consider are the most important things to think consider when applying.

## Start early

The summer between your 3rd and 4th year of Bachelor‚Äôs studies (or 2nd and 3rd, if your degree lasts 3 years) is the best time to have some reflection on what you would like to do in the future. The reason for this is that many European universities require the application to be made very early. For example, if you are looking to apply to some Swiss universities, the application might be due in the middle of December. But, that is not the earliest it can get - the deadline for some can be already in November. So, as soon as you start your final year, you will already need to start preparing your applications, in case you want to continue your masters right after you graduate. You do not want to miss the opportunity to apply to some great universities.

## Define your filters

It might sound obvious, but still, there are so many universities out there and so many different programs, it is hard to get a grasp of all of that. Therefore, you absolutely need to have filters! Take some time to think about what those are. These were mine: the university had to have scholarship options, it had to be in a Western or North European country and the program had to be in English. It‚Äôs not too many conditions, I wasn‚Äôt tied to specific countries for example, but it still narrowed down my research a lot. Therefore, be sure to have at least one filter before you start your search. In order to make the search easier, find ranking lists, such as Shanghai, Times Higher Education, or the Guardian list (for UK universities), go through them, and check the unis. You should not care too much about the rankings at this moment - you only need these lists to know what universities exist out there in the world.

## Pick a few universities

When deciding which universities to apply to, you start with a very broad picture and then end up with a small portion of it. In order to make a transition, make sure to write everything down (and I cannot stress this enough). In my case, I used a sheet with all the information about a great number of universities, and that number, in the end, has dropped to only six. Once, I saw a YouTuber with a huge sheet, having 15+ universities to which she intended to apply to. In my opinion, that is way too much. Each application takes a lot of time and energy, it may require preparing for an interview or even an entrance exam. Many universities charge quite a fee for applications (Switzerland, I am looking at you) and others have more complicated ways of applying (German uni-assist, I am talking about you). Considering you want to study for a master's right after you end your bachelor‚Äôs degree, you will need to apply throughout your last year and, having in mind all courses, exams, and writing thesis (and having a life!), you do not want to waste your energy. I think that applying to too many universities does not increase your chances of getting into one, but actually decreases them as you will hardly have enough time to devote to each university as much as you should. Therefore, you should play smart and make a shortlist, something like this:

1. The one that is probably really hard to get into (usually a dream university)
2. The one that is moderately hard to get into
3. The other one that is also moderately hard to get into
4. The one that seems pretty easy to get into, AKA safe option

## Applying with someone

Although it might sound comforting to go with someone to pursue a master's abroad, the process of applying can actually be very dreadful. In my case, I was applying with my partner who was studying for a computer science degree. So, he was looking for a software engineering master's degree, while I was looking for life science degrees, therefore, two completely different fields! We struggled a lot to find perfectly matching universities for both of our wishes and there were a huge number of universities we had to drop because they did not fit one of us. So, if you are reading this and have a partner with whom you want to go abroad to study, I see you, I feel you and I can only say this - it will take a lot of energy and nerves, but it is feasible. My partner and I managed to find and get into a university that was a great match for both of us, although, in the end, we did not go there (which is another great story of the unexpected turn of the life events that I might cover some next time!)

In the end, applying to universities abroad for a master‚Äôs degree is HARD. You will spend hours online just researching stuff, let alone writing motivation letters and preparing for interviews. It is one of the hardest things I had to do in my life, but it was totally worth the pain. At the end of the day, I ended up studying in one of the greatest cities in the world. And I wish you the same! Go out there and ace those applications! üí™
